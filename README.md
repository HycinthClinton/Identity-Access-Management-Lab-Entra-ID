# Microsoft Entra ID Identity Management Lab

This repository contains my hands-on lab work for the AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator certification.  
My learning approach focuses on practical, step-by-step exercises to build real experience with Azure services.

## Lab Overview
This lab covers the following tasks:

- Creating users in Microsoft Entra ID  
- Creating a security group  
- Adding members to the group  
- Deploying a Windows Server 2025 virtual machine  
- Assigning RBAC permissions to allow the group to manage the VM  

The goal of this lab is to understand identity management, access control and basic resource deployment in Azure.
